## fatatni-salah (still under development)
 Description: Fatatni Salah is a prayer tracking app designed for Muslims. It utilizes the 'awesome_notifications' package to send timely notifications after each prayer, enabling users to mark completion or record missed prayers. Leveraging 'hive' for data storage, the app seamlessly logs missed prayers locally, allowing users to view all missed prayers and delete them once prayed. Integrated with a prayers API, it fetches accurate prayer timings based on the user's location. Fatatni Salah streamlines prayer tracking, empowering users to maintain regular observance with ease and precision.ðŸ™ŒðŸ•Œ
